# Example sbt project archetypes using FreeMarker templates

## Projects
- **scala-sbt.ftl**
- **sbt-autoplugin.ftl**
- **scala-native.ftl**

## Using the sandbox for evaluation
The sandbox project is included for convenience. It is a bare, minimal sbt project with the `sbt-fmpp-template` plugin installed. You can use it to evaluate the included example projects.

## Evaluating these templates from your local environment
Alternatively, you can evaluate these templates from your local environment. An installation of the `sbt-fmpp-template` plugin is required. It is recommended to install it globally, however, it will also work if installed on a given project. The project on which the plugin is installed must be used as the sbt session which will evaluate the templates.
